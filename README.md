# Project-Dashboard-Covid

This project repo contains a dashboard with the information about Covid-19. It gives you a visualization of the Covid cases over time. 
For this dashboard we use Streamlit and a dataset from Johns Hopkins University. 
Our dashboard is interactive and allows the user to:
1. Select which countries to display (among a pre-defined list).
2. Select which time period to display (i.e. user could choose start and finish dates).
3. Select which variable(s) to display: number / cumulated number / 7-day rolling average of confirmed cases / deaths / (recovered).
